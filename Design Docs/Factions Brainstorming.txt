Dynamic Factions

We need a number of factions to poulate the world. I want those to be dynamically generated in the future, but for now I should write out some so I know what kind of output I want.

The Other
	- An outsider faction. Wants to get in.
	- Can also be The Trapped
	- Gives power at a cost.
	- What is the cost?
	- How does it get in?
	- Generate a web of "weak points" accross the map where bad shit can happen.
	- Ressurection!!!!!!! There's permadeath, unless you make a pact with the Other! Things tend to get worse every time you're brought back though...

The Pactforged
	- Takes power from the Outsider, but uses it for her own purposes

The Deciever
	- Acts like a good guy, actually draws power from the Other
	
The Cusader
	- Wants to eliminate the Other
	- May not know of the Other, and is focused on the Pactforged


What are some other intersting locations or NPC quests?

tropes from games:
	- Go to temples to collect the elemental things
	-
